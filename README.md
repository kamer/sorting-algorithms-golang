## Sorting Algorithms Implemented in Go
As a newbie gopher I implemented sorting algorithms with basic explanations written at comments. There may be some traces from my Java background which are not considered appropriate for Go (especially naming conventions and lack of pointer usage). So please, feel free to correct me and contribute.
